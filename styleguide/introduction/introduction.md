> MOM Design System was established as a single source of truth and a unified language for cross-functional teams.

Built by WINS designers and developers, it will be scaled for the DX+ team and across all of MOM.

The system is composed of tangible elements such as guidelines and tools for designers and developers. It also contains abstract elements such as shared ways of working and beliefs.

## What is a Design System?

A design system is made up of basic elements, such as colours and text styles, that **lay the foundation for building components and patterns**.

They serve many functions such as:

- Maintaining consistency across products
- Elevating user experience
- Convey MOM's brand values of Progressiveness, Proactiveness & People-focused
- Establishing a shared language among cross functional teams
- Onboarding new members

> **The MOM Design System Mission:** To establish a unified language for all, bringing order and consistency to our digital products. It empowers teams to problem-solve instead of pixel pushing enabling us to build high quality experiences, holding us to high standards of work.

## How to use this documentation

Whether it's creating a new feature/template/page or iterating on an existing workflow, all members should routinely refer here.

A good design system **evolves to meet the ever-changing business requirements and user needs**. Thus, it's important to **document and update guidelines regularly** as they help team members get on the same page.

### For designers:

We have a team of designers who are in charge of the Design System. They define assets within the library, advocate for the system and demonstrate its value. Often, they hold discussions with other designers to iterate on the system. This document should be used together with the Figma Design Libraries. Click [here](#/Introduction/For%20designers) to find out more.

### For developers:

A problem every team faces with design systems is keeping the design and code in sync. This document contains specifications on different component states (eg. primary/secondary buttons, active/hover/disabled states) that are in line with design guidelines. Developers can refer here to establish a reliable front-end infrastructure that prioritizes communication and efficient workflows.

### For products owners and stakeholders:

Design systems go beyond than just a collection of design elements. This resource allows product managers to scale from just a few screens to multiple platforms with developed patterns. It also captures how products communicate to end-users, complete with look and feel as well as tone of voice.
